## Worker Proxy

Worker Proxy is a Cloudflare Workers based proxy server that proxies incoming requests through to downstream servers. It has the following features:

- Supports multiple downstream servers.
  - Downstream servers are chosen based on the URL path of the incoming requests.
  - The first path segment determines the downstream server. The remaining segments are passed through to the downstream server.
- For each downstream server, custom headers can be set, that are sent with each outgoing downstream request.
  - This includes headers like Authorization.
- The downstream servers configuration is stored in Cloudflare Workers KV.
- Each configured downstream server can also be configured to require authn/authz.
  - Auth headers set in incoming requests are compared to the configured auth for the relevant downstream server.

This project has been wholly coded by AI, with some minor fixes by me. using mainly the excellent GLM 4.6 model by Z.AI with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd worker-proxy
bun install
```

2. Configure your KV namespace:
```bash
# Create a KV namespace
wrangler kv:namespace create "PROXY_SERVERS"

# Update wrangler.toml with the returned ID
```

3. Set up proxy configuration:
```bash
# Run the interactive configuration script
bun run scripts/update-proxy-config.ts
```

4. Test locally:
```bash
bun run dev
```

5. Deploy to Cloudflare:
```bash
bun run deploy
```

The configuration script will guide you through setting up proxy servers, authentication, and secrets interactively.

## Configuration

The proxy configuration is stored in KV with each server as a separate key. The worker includes an interactive configuration script for easy setup and management.

### Configuration Management Script

Use the included interactive script for managing proxy configurations:

```bash
# Run the configuration script
bun run scripts/update-proxy-config.ts
```

The script provides:
- **Interactive setup**: Guided configuration for new proxy servers
- **Multi-auth support**: Configure multiple authentication headers
- **Secret generation**: Auto-generate secure tokens and save as Cloudflare secrets
- **Validation**: Built-in configuration validation
- **Legacy migration**: Automatic conversion from old auth format to new multi-auth format

### Secret Management

The proxy supports secret interpolation using the `${SECRET_NAME}` pattern in authentication and header values.

#### Setting Secrets

Use wrangler to set secrets:

```bash
# Set a secret value
wrangler secret put API_TOKEN

# Set multiple secrets
wrangler secret put DB_PASSWORD
wrangler secret put SERVICE_KEY
```

#### Using Secrets in Configuration

```json
{
  "api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "authConfigs": [
      {
        "header": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
      }
    ],
    "headers": {
      "X-Service-Key": "${SERVICE_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Notes:**
- Secrets are never logged or exposed in responses
- Missing secrets in authentication values will cause requests to fail
- Missing secrets in header values will fall back to the placeholder text
- Use descriptive secret names for easier management

#### Common Secret Patterns

```bash
# Bearer token authentication
Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}

# API key authentication
X-API-Key: ${SERVICE_API_KEY}

# Custom authentication
X-Custom-Auth: ${CUSTOM_AUTH_VALUE}
```

### Configuration Schema

Each server configuration supports:

- `url` (required): Base URL of the downstream server (must be HTTPS)
- `headers` (optional): Custom headers to add to outgoing requests (supports secret interpolation)
- `auth` (optional): Required authentication header value for incoming requests (legacy)
- `authHeader` (optional): Custom header name for authentication (defaults to `Authorization`) (legacy)
- `authConfigs` (optional): Array of multiple authentication configurations (new)

### Example Configuration

Here's an example configuration showing various features:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "headers": {
      "X-Custom": "value",
      "X-Service-ID": "${SERVICE_ID}"
    },
    "authConfigs": [
      {
        "header": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
      }
    ]
  },
  "web": {
    "url": "https://web.example.com"
  },
  "images": {
    "url": "https://cdn.example.com",
    "headers": {
      "X-CDN": "true",
      "X-CDN-Key": "${CDN_API_KEY}"
    }
  },
  "custom-auth": {
    "url": "https://secure-api.example.com",
    "auth": "${SECRET_API_KEY}",
    "authHeader": "X-API-Key"
  },
  "multi-auth": {
    "url": "https://flexible-api.example.com",
    "authConfigs": [
      {
        "header": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}"
      },
      {
        "header": "X-API-Key",
        "value": "${API_KEY}"
      },
      {
        "header": "X-Service-Token",
        "value": "${SERVICE_TOKEN}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Authentication Headers

The new `authConfigs` array supports multiple authentication methods with the following schema:

```typescript
interface AuthConfig {
  header: string        // Header name (e.g., "Authorization", "X-API-Key")
  value: string         // Expected header value (supports ${SECRET_NAME} placeholders)
}
```

**Authentication Logic:**
- **Any One Match**: Access is granted if any configured auth header matches
- **All Headers Optional**: All auth headers are optional by default
- **No Auth Headers Present**: If no auth headers are configured, access is granted without authentication

### Request Routing

- Request to `/api/users/123` → routes to `api` server → `https://api.example.com/users/123`
- Request to `/web/dashboard` → routes to `web` server → `https://web.example.com/dashboard`
- Request to `/images/photo.jpg` → routes to `images` server → `https://cdn.example.com/photo.jpg`

### Header Forwarding

The proxy forwards headers as follows:

- **All incoming headers** are passed to the downstream server **except** the authentication headers
  - Default: `Authorization` header is not forwarded
  - Custom: If `authHeader` is configured, that header is not forwarded instead
  - Multiple: All headers configured in `authConfigs` are not forwarded
- **Configured headers** are added only if they don't already exist in the incoming request
  - Incoming headers take priority over configured headers
  - This allows clients to override default headers when needed

**Example:**
```json
{
  "api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "headers": { "X-Default": "${DEFAULT_VALUE}" },
    "auth": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
  }
}
```

- Request with `X-Default: client-value` → downstream receives `X-Default: client-value` (client wins)
- Request without `X-Default` → downstream receives `X-Default: config-value` (config provides default)
- `Authorization` header is never forwarded to the downstream server

**Multiple Auth Headers Example:**
```json
{
  "multi-auth": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "authConfigs": [
      { "header": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" },
      { "header": "X-API-Key", "value": "${SERVICE_KEY}" }
    ]
  }
}
```

- Request with both auth headers → downstream receives neither `Authorization` nor `X-API-Key`
- Both authentication headers are removed for security before forwarding to the downstream server
- Secret interpolation happens before header comparison and removal

### Authentication

If a server has an `auth` configuration, incoming requests must include a matching authentication header. By default, this is the `Authorization` header:

#### Default Authorization Header
```
Authorization: Bearer required-token
```

#### Custom Authentication Header
You can also specify a custom header name using `authHeader`:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "auth": "secret-api-key-123",
    "authHeader": "X-API-Key"
  }
}
```

Then the incoming request must include:
```
X-API-Key: secret-api-key-123
```

If the required header is missing or doesn't match, the proxy returns a 401 Unauthorized response.

#### Multiple Authentication Examples

**Example 1: Any One Valid Header**
```json
{
  "flexible-api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "authConfigs": [
      { "header": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer ${TOKEN_123}" },
      { "header": "X-API-Key", "value": "${KEY_456}" }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Request with `Authorization: Bearer token123` → ✅ Success
- Request with `X-API-Key: key456` → ✅ Success
- Request with `Authorization: wrong` → ❌ 401 Unauthorized
- Request with no auth headers → ✅ Success (all optional)

**Example 2: Service-Specific Authentication**
```json
{
  "service-api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "authConfigs": [
      { "header": "X-Service-Token", "value": "${SERVICE_TOKEN}" },
      { "header": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer ${BACKUP_TOKEN}" }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Request with `X-Service-Token: service789` → ✅ Success
- Request with `Authorization: Bearer token123` → ✅ Success
- Request with both headers → ✅ Success (any one match is sufficient)
- Request with no headers → ❌ 401 Unauthorized (auth configured but none provided)

**Example 3: Multiple API Key Support**
```json
{
  "multi-key-api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "authConfigs": [
      { "header": "X-API-Key-V1", "value": "${LEGACY_API_KEY}" },
      { "header": "X-API-Key", "value": "${NEW_API_KEY}" },
      { "header": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer ${FALLBACK_TOKEN}" }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Supports multiple authentication methods for backward compatibility
- Clients can use any of the configured authentication methods
- Useful during API migrations or when supporting multiple client types

#### Backward Compatibility & Migration

**Legacy configurations continue to work unchanged:**
```json
{
  "legacy-api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "auth": "Bearer required-token",
    "authHeader": "Authorization"
  }
}
```

**Mixed configurations (legacy + new):**
```json
{
  "mixed-api": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com",
    "auth": "Bearer legacy-token",
    "authHeader": "X-Legacy-Auth",
    "authConfigs": [
      { "header": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer new-token" }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Both `Authorization: Bearer new-token` and `X-Legacy-Auth: Bearer legacy-token` will work
- If header names conflict, `authConfigs` takes precedence

**Migration from legacy to new format:**
```json
// Before (legacy)
{
  "auth": "Bearer token123",
  "authHeader": "X-API-Key"
}

// After (new)
{
  "authConfigs": [
    { "header": "X-API-Key", "value": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" }
  ]
}
```
